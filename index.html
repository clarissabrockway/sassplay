				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>Do you want some cupcakes? <span class="crab-block"><!-- You peeked! -->Heck</span> yeah, you do! Come to Auntie Crab's for the best imaginary cupcakes you will ever have. Most cupcake bakeries produce cupcakes that or too sweet and use too much frosting. At Auntie Crab's, we have found the perfect frosting:cake ratio. It is perfect because we said so.</p>
				<p>Auntie Crab's Cupcakes was established in February 2015 (it was a Thursday) when our fearless founder decided she wanted to play with SASS and make a cupcake in Adobe Illustrator. Since that day, she has used this page as a creative outlet to experiment with CSS3, PHP, Javascript, and SVG animation.</p>
				<p>Be sure to check out our <a href="#flavors" alt="flavors" title="flavors">flavors</a>. Once you've picked out which ones you want, read up on our fabulous <a href="#location" alt="location" title="location">location</a>. Have a question? Too bad.</p>

				<p>Auntie Crab's Cupcakes is located in a small seaside town in Clarissa Brockway's brain. The d√©cor is amazing, trust me. Clarissa is a front-end developer living and working in Dallas, Texas.</p>
				<p>This page is a playground of sorts and a fun way for her to teach herself new front-end development techniques.</p>
				<p>Are you craving cupcakes now? Take a peek at Clarissa's CV. She sometimes brings cupcakes to work and she's willing to relocate!</p>
